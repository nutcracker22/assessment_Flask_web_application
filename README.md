# assessment_Flask_web_application

First steps:
- created GitHub repository assessment_Flask_web_application
- cloned GitHub repository into PyCharm
- setup Codio virtual environment and updated python version
- cloned GitHub repository into Codio
- chose a dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/hamzansariii/latest-popular-movies-dataset
- identified a need to cut part of the data (only movies between 2007 and 2022), because otherwise the database would 
  contain more than 7000 data sets
- designed the database using hand-drawn database diagram
- wrote the first draft of code for movie_db.py (the database creator file)
- setup a development branch in GitHub
- committed the first draft to the development branch
- ran the code and checked the error messages
- implemented work-arounds for this and similar errors
- ran again to create the first version of the database
- inspected database to look for semantic errors, which might be caused by mistakes in the original dataset
- wrote workarounds for those
